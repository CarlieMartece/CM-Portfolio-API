Then a software engineering bootcamp changed everything. Since graduating I've applied new skills in JavaScript, React and SQL to what is now an artist, writer and coder portfolio. I'm particularly pleased with the new Art gallery's search functionality. Code is my art now, and my favourite thing to write. I couldn't be more pleased with my creative journey's progression."
