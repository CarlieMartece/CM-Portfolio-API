    blurb:
      'Toxic Nursery is a deranged journey through the life of an artist with a dissociative mental health condition. Hurtling at breakneck speed through a series of bleak yet hilarious misadventures, it explores the different facets of a fractured mind - from meek terror to unhinged exhibitionism, from cold cynicism to irritating mania, and from academic introversion to vitriolic fury. Often scathing in its view of humanity, this book cheerfully mocks the "misery memoir" genre by turning dark subjects into even darker comedy.\n "It\'s all incredibly tragic. Like death. Like poverty. Like losing your favourite kitten, in a junkyard, on acid, at Christmas."\n Combining the edgy surrealism of high-concept sci-fi with the emotional intensity of mental health biography, this vicious parody is designed to make the reader question existing notions of self and sanity. The sardonic and lyrical narrative voice guides you across a roller coaster storyline while events play out with an almost beautiful brutality. Toxic Nursery reads as a poem crossed with a joke, mixed with an artist\'s manifesto and a psychological case study and presented as a contemporary fairy tale.\n"It\'s bad enough having a small frame and skinny arms, without having a masochistic twin who opens the door to strangers. It takes veins full of nitroglycerine and hatred just to counterbalance the incessant invitation to violation."\nSearing honesty combines with a twisted sense of humour to pour an unflinching spotlight onto the myriad of truths shaping the human character. Uncensored in theme or language, Martece’s writing is not suitable for those easily offended. This demented account of a creative life involves “courage”, art, madness, badgers, demons, alien princesses, broken mirrors, Gothic melodrama, nudity and petrol.',

    blurb:
      "Leah lies in a coma, a victim of the evil Poisoner. Only Ash can save her. But Ash is a hunted criminal in the high-surveillance metropolis of Deragon Hex. Their three most useful allies are a night porter, a mutilated vagrant and a creepy dominatrix.\nThis tale begins at the blood-drenched site of a mass murder, then rewinds to play the toxic events that brought the killer to this point. One of Leah's four biggest enemies is hellbent on her demise. And only one sinister observer can reveal her true nemesis.\nAfter leaving the ruined hotel suite in Blue Five Nine, the story careens through narcotised festivals, disastrous relationships, vulture trials, prison fights, televised violence and surreal dream sequences, with frequent social commentary from two voyeuristic alcoholics. The six-sided setting is populated by mentally vacant consumers and insidious social climbers, but also a helpful prison clerk, a mysterious night porter and a cat that drinks vodka.\nCan Ash save Leah before the vultures strike?",

The strange pair cling to shreds of sanity while people around them disappear.\nThe third book in the Constructed Sanity series combines the terrifying honesty of Toxic Nursery with the complex yet captivating plot of The Vipdile Key.\nCould intergalactic battle training save these troubled siblings?\nWill they solve Summerton's mysteries or be consumed by demonic forces?\nWhere are they?\nWhen are they?\nAnd why does a vengeful witch haunt their cryptic dreams?\nRescue is not coming.",

    blurb:
      "Welcome to our mindscape. It's a tragic, triumphant, and brutally hilarious place to be…\nHoneysuckle wants love any way she can get it. If that means constantly falling for predators, at least it feels good. And with her hell-bent on a stubborn stiletto-stumble down a path of self-destructive debauchery, Management struggles to contain the chaos.\nAlicia isn't going under without taking the whole world with her. Arriving during their teens from the smouldering embers of their nightmares, the furious alter battles to drive away everybody in the Reality Show to establish safety.\nAs Honeysuckle and Alicia catapult everyone through terrifyingly toxic, madcap misadventures, can they stop hating each other long enough to heal?\n In an original semi-autobiographical novel parodying the misery memoir, Carlie Martece explores the horrifying and hysterical truth of living with dissociative identity disorder triggered by childhood abuse. With superb storytelling aimed through the sharp lens of macabre humour, they invite anyone struggling with self-acceptance to find hope in their wonderfully demented and courageous quest to love themselves.\nToxic Nursery is the first book in the Constructed Sanity dark comedy series. If you enjoy fascinatingly complex heroines, hard-won triumphs over trauma, and twisted absurdity, then you'll be blown away by Carlie Martece's beautifully authentic journey.",
