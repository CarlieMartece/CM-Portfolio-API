    further_info: "This is where my coding journey began. Years ago, I created an online artist portfolio using basic HTML and CSS. With my visual art skills, I made the site look good but struggled to make it interactive. Then a software engineering bootcamp changed everything. Since graduating I've applied new skills in JavaScript, React and SQL to what is now an artist, writer and coder portfolio. I'm particularly pleased with the new Art gallery's search functionality. Code is my art now, and my favourite thing to write. I couldn't be more pleased with my creative journey's progression."

    further_info: "My first finished app! During the bootcamp's solo project phase, this portfolio was still static, and NC News was my first use of JavaScript, React and SQL to make an interactive site. I was glad I managed to create a functional and well-presented site to such a tight deadline. If I ever return to this project, I'll add a user login component and update the styling for improved accessibility.",

    further_info: "My first group coding project. We were encouraged to use new tech, so I quickly learned React Native and Expo Camera. React Native took some adjustment with the differences in styling, but I overcame this to craft the Navigation bar and Gallery. The contribution I'm most proud of is the Camera screen. I was so happy seeing a picture taken on my phone's camera held in state. After I pushed this code, my colleagues working on the image recognition could run photos direct from the app. We were pleased with how it all came together."

    description: "Complementary therapist's website",
    further_info: "My first site using Vue.JS. I love React, but thought I should try other front-end frameworks before deciding it's my favourite. Also my first time using SCSS. Who knew CSS could look so tidy? I'm definitely an SCSS convert, but still not sure if I prefer Vue to React. This small, static site was much improved with Vue's reusable components, replacing the previous HTML-only repeated navigation. I also added semantic HMTL for improved accessibility, and CSS responsive design so it looks great on different screen sizes."
